Here at cloudmesh, we develop services through providers to support your

Here we are especially interested in using the following services:

-  **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)** Amazon EC2 is web service that
   enables users to perform elastic web-scable computing while having
   complete control over instances. It is integrated with most AWS
   services such as Amazon S3, RDS, and VPC.

-  **Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)** Amazon S3 an object storage
   service that offers a wide range of storage classes.

We provide a step-by-step guide on how to create an AWS account through
the AWS webpage to utilize these services.

Fill out your payment information and proceed. Dependent on your level
of security, you may want to explore using a prepaid credit card if you
do not want to use your regular credit card.

If you just started using AWS, you will have a free account for a while
as AWS will state:

   We will not charge you unless your usage exceeds the AWS Free Tier
   Limits. - Amazon AWS

Please review the terms of the free tier carefully.
