# Azure Blob Storage and Account Creation

## Azure Blob Storage

Azure Storage is Microsoft's cloud storage solution for modern data 
storage scenarios. Azure Blob storage is Microsoft's object storage 
solution for the cloud. Blob storage is optimized for storing massive 
amounts of data. 

Blob storage offers three types of resources:

* The storage account.
* A container in the storage account
* A blob in a container

  new resource group.

for use. As a firt step, a `Container` should be created in the Blob storage. 
A container organizes a set of blobs, similar to a directory in a file system. 
A default `Container` should be set in the `cloudmesh4.yaml` file details  of 
which are outlined

after first 30 days to get continued access to free productsâ€”some for the 
first 12 months.
